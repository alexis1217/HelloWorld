    <h1>ENSLAVED AFRICANS - “INDOLENT” nor “STUPID” by no means! </h1>
    
    <p>
   “The dull [s]tupidity of the Negro leaves him without any de[s]ire for in[s]truction. Whether the Creator originally formed the[s]e black people[s] a little lower than other men, or that they have lo[s]t their intellectual powers through di[s]u[s]e, I will not assume the province of determining; but certain it is, that a (new Negro as tho[s]e lately imported from Africa are called), is a complete definition of indolent [s]tupidity, nor could a more forcible means be employed for the conver[s]ion of a dei[s]t, than fetting one of the[s]e creatures before him, as an example of man in a [s]tate of nature, unbiaffed by revelation or education.”

  <h2>LEARNING TO READ WOULD GRANT THE ENSLAVED, KNOWLEDGE & POWER…to rebel against their enslavers!</h2>
    <p>
      “The right of the planter to his Negroe is only founded on the acts of his provincial a[ss]embly and beyond their juri[s]diction he had no power over him. If he teaches his Negroe to read one book, he will of himself read another, and [s]uch has been the imprudence of [s]ome ill-informed writers, that books are not wanting to exhort Negroes to rebel again[s]t their masters.
